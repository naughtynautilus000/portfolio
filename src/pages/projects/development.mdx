## Overview

The Development project is a class project done for CSCI1300: UI/UX. In this
project, I was tasked to create an interactive list-based user interface with
the [React](https://reactjs.org/) library. You can interact with my interface
[here](https://naughtynautilus000.github.io/development/).

## Goals & Requirements

The goal of the Development project is to create a list-based user interface
using React.

The first key feature of this interface is the list of items. The interface
must include a list of at least 12 _item cards_ which all follow a theme. This
might be pastries on a bakery site.

The second key feature of this interface is the _aggregator_. The aggregator is
a component that collects item cards selected by the user and displays data
specific to the item cards aggregated by the user. An example of an aggregator
is a shopping cart where the aggregated data is the total price of all the items
in the cart.

In addition to the aggregator, the user interface must include the following
features:

- A method to add and remove item cards from the aggregator.
- A _sort feature_ that allows the user to sort the item cards by at least one
  attribute.
- A _filter feature_ that allows the user to filter the items cards by at least
  two attributes.
- All components on the interface should be visible
- The list of card items and the aggregator must be on _one_ page.

## Project Implementation

### The Item Cards

The theme I chose for my interface was the NBA. The list items cards is the list
of the [2022 NBA All-Stars](https://www.nba.com/allstar/2022/all-star-roster).
Each item card displays the following information:

- The player's name
- An image of the player
- Which All-Star team the player was one
- The total number of All-Star teams the player has made for their career
- The total number of All-NBA teams the player has made for their career

Additionally, each item card has a button that the user can click to add the
player to their favorites. Below is an image of the item card for LeBron James:

### The Aggregator

The aggregator for my interface collects the users favorite players. The user
adds players to the aggregator using the Add to Favorites button. The interface
then displays two aggregated values: the average number of All-Star teams that
the user's favorite players have made, and the average number of All-NBA teams
that the user's favorite players have made.

### The Sort and Filter Features

<div class="flex flex-row gap-10">
<div class="relative flex-auto">
<img src="/pages/development/menu.png" alt="interface menu" class="absolute max-h-full w-auto"/>
</div>
<div class="content flex-[2]">
#### Sorting

My interface allows users to sort players by three values:

- Popularity (Number of All-Star votes received)
- Number of All-Star appearances
- Number of All-NBA appearances

Users can only sort by at most one value at once.

#### Filtering

The filters for my interface are broken into four groups:

- Team
- Starter/Reserve
- Position
- Other (first-time All-Stars, and user Favorites)

For the Team, Starter/Reserve, and Position groups, there is a set of 2-3
_mutually-exclusive_ options that the user can choose from. The user may select
at most one option from each of these three groups.

The option in the "Other" group are not mutually exclusive, so the user may
select any number of options in this group.

#### Reset

At the bottom of the menu there is a reset button which will clear the user's
favorite players, clear all of the user's selected filters, and set the selected
sort option to popularity. This is the initial state of the interface when the
user first loads the page.
