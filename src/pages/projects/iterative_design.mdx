## Overview

The Iterative Design project is a class project done for CSCI1300: UI/UX. In
this project, a group of four students selects an emerging startup completes
the full iterative processes of mocking up a solution to the startup's concept.

## Goals & Requirements

The goal of the Iterative Design project is to complete the iterative design
process of prototyping an interface that solves the concept of a chosen startup.
The iterative design process consists of following steps:

1. Initial Hand-Drawn Sketches

2. Unified Low-Fidelity Wireframe

3. Interactive High-Fidelity Mock-up

4. Prototype Critique

5. Revisions

After the critique and revisions to our hi-fi mock up, our group deploys our
prototype to [usertesting.com](https://www.usertesting.com/) for feedback from
real users. For the sake of the assignment, our group does not change our final
design with these revisions but instead lists the revisions we would make with
the user testing feedback.

## Choosing the Startup

The startup our group chose was [FoodCourt](https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/foodcourt):

> FoodCourt (CoKitchen) is Africa's leading virtual restaurant company.
> We've served over 350,000 meals in the last 12 months & our goal is to make
> good food and quick convenience goods more accessible across Africa, through
> virtual restaurants & dark stores.

In essence, FoodCourt provides an on-demand delivery and pick-up service for
restaurants in Africa, similar to DoorDash or UberEats in the United States.

## Iterative Design Process

### Pre-Design Thinking

Our group chose to create a mobile interface. We chose to prototype a mobile
interface due to the on-demand nature of the FoodCourt service. The target
audience for this service are adults with mobile phones.

### Initial Hand-Drawn Sketches

Each group member created a set of 3-4 sketches of potential views to be
included in the final prototypes:

### Prototyping

Our group created a unified wireframe in [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/) by
combining the best features from each set of sketches. Some common features of
all of the sketches include a home page, a search page, and a details page for
each restaurant. From our sketches, we came up with 5 views to be included in
the wireframe:

1. A login page

2. A home page

3. A search page

4. A restaurant page

5. A cart page

After creating the wireframe views, we used the prototyping software [Figma](https://www.figma.com/about/)
to create the high fidelity prototypes. Below are screenshots of both the
high-fidelity and low-fidelity prototypes of each of the listed views:

### Prototype Critique

In the prototype critique, our group presented our Figma prototype to other
groups working on the same project. Additionally, each group had the opportunity
to interact with the prototype in Figma. Here is some of the critiques we
received on our design:

- _Search Bar_: There was no easy way to navigate out of the search page without
  clicking a restaurant first. This causes confusion

- _Hours Label on Search Page_: On the search page, there was a label that
  said "hours" for each listed restaurant. Our critics though it would be
  helpful to list the actual hours instead of the label.

- _Hours Label on Restaurant Page_: On the restaurant page, a users noted that
  the hours sections would be more clear if they replaced the section with an
  open/closed banner that indicates whether the restaurant is opened or closed.

- _Reviews on Restaurant Page_: On the restaurant page, there is a 5-star rating
  for each restaurant. Users suggested that the scale also show the number of
  reviews to help them determine the accuracy of the rating

- _Notes section on Cart Page_: One user said the increase the contrast of the
  notes text to improve readability

- _Delete Button on Cart Page_: For each item in the cart, there is a red button
  with the text "delete" that users can press to remove the item from the cart.
  Some users felt that the intention of the button would be more clear if the
  text "delete" were replaced by a trashcan icon.

### Revisions and Final Prototype

Our group incorporated the feedback we received from the prototype critique to
revise our original Figma mock up into the final prototype. The revisions we
made include:

- Changing the delete button text on the cart page to a trashcan icon

- Setting the notes text on the cart page to black for higher contrast

- Adding a navigation footer to the search page

- Replacing the "hours" labels on the search and restaurant pages with an
  indicator that states whether the restaurant is opened or closed.

- Adding the number of reviews next to the 5-star rating for each restaurant.

Below is an imbedded version of the final prototype that you can interact with.

## User Testing

With our revised Figma prototype, our group uploaded our test to
[usertesting.com](https://www.usertesting.com/) to gain feedback from real
potential users. To test our interface, we had users complete the following
task:

> Imagine you're hungry and there are no restaurants around, so you decide to
> order delivery. You decide you want chicken tacos from your favorite
> restaurant Deddeh's Kitchen. Navigate through the app to Deddeh's Kitchen,
> and add the chicken tacos to your cart. Then, press the checkout button.
> Please think aloud when you navigate through the site as it helps us build a
> better understanding of the user's thought process. Additionally, this is not
> a real app but instead an interactive mockup built using the prototyping
> software Figma.

When the user starts the test, they are presented with our interface's login
page. From their, it is up to the user to complete the task.

### Summary of User Testing Results

#### Task Completion

All tester were able to successfully complete the task.

#### Some notes on tester behavior

- Some testers had difficulty finding a way to checkout

- Some testers pressed the "open" label for a restaurant on the home page as if
  it was a button (The intent of this label is to indicate that the restaurant is
  open).

- One tester struggled to continue with the task after the item was added to the
  cart. They mentioned putting the navbar at the top of the page instead of the
  bottom would be more efficient.

#### Some recommendations from the testers

- One tester recommended that we use icons instead of having text labels on
  the navbar links.
  
- One tester suggested that having a few reviews present on the details page
  would be more helpful than having to go to a different page to read all the
  reviews.

### Potential Interface Changes

- Add a label to indicate the open/close indicator is an indicator and not a
  button.

- Add an animation that indicates to press the cart button to checkout

- Change the links in the navbar to include icons

- Keep the position of the navbar fixed across all of the views

- Add some reviews to the restaurant details page
