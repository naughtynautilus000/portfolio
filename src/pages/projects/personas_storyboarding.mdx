## Overview

The Personas and Storyboarding project is a class project done for CSCI1300:
UI/UX. This project is an exercise in the development of [user personas](https://xd.adobe.com/ideas/process/user-research/putting-personas-to-work-in-ux-design/).
In this project, I was tasked with observing real-world users interacting
with an interface of my choosing and then develop user personas, and
corresponding storyboards, that are representative of the real-world users I
observed.

## Learning Goals and Requirements

INSERT SOME BULLSHIT HERE

## The Chosen Interface

The interface I chose for this project was the keyboard. Specifically, I chose
to observe users only using the keyboards found on MacBook laptops. This has
the benefits of a standard keyboard layout between users, as well as provide
an abundance of potential users to observe.

The keyboard itself is made up of rows of keys (buttons) that can print text,
to the screen, remove text from the screen and control other functions of the
laptop such as changing the brightness of the screen or shutting down the
computer altogether.

All of the keys have labels indicating their purpose. All of the keys are
labeled to inform the user of the possible functionalities. The keys can be
pressed individually to perform a function or can be pressed in combination
with other keys.

## User Observations

<ul class="flex flex-wrap justify-around list-none">
  <li class="bg-dark-blue rounded-3xl flex-[1_1_250px] p-5 border-2 m-1 border-blue">
    <h3 class="text-center">User 1</h3>
    <h4 class="text-center"><em>Computer Science</em></h4>
    <p class="user-description">
      This user was programming. The programs they were using were VS Code
      and Google Chrome.
    </p>
    <ul class="notes">
      <li>
        This user made frequent user of keyboard shortcuts
      </li>
      <li>
        This user's function keys acted like a Windows computer. Meaning
        that F5 reloaded the web browser page and F12 brought up the
        browser development tools.
      </li>
      <li>
        This user never used the CMD, Option, or Shift keys on the right
        side of the keyboard.
      </li>
      <li>
        This user used keyboard shortcuts to achieve what most users will
        do with a track pad. This includes using a shortcut to select
        large blocks of text and a shortcut to change the active window
        between VS Code and Google Chrome.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>

        This user never used the CMD, Option, or Shift keys on the right side of the keyboard.
      </li>
      <li>
        This user did not use keyboard shortcuts. When they needed to change the font from
        normal to bold, select the text they needed to change and then click on the bold
        button on the top of page using the track pad.
      </li>
      <li>
        This user did not use the function keys.

        This user never used the track pad.
      </li>
      <li>

      </li>
      <li>
        This user's function keys perform different actions than User 1. The keys did what was
        indicated on the label (change brightness, adjust volume, etc.)
      </li>
      <li>
        This user typed with two fingers.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

#### Key Observations

- None of the users used the CMD, Option, or Shift keys on the right side
  of the keyboard.
- The function keys performed different actions between users.
- All users had unique typing styles.

## Question Responses

### When do you use the function keys on your keyboard, if at all?

- One user recently migrated to a MacBook from a Windows laptop and changed the
  default function key behavior in their settings to mimic the Windows behavior.
  Some of the changes include F5 being used to refresh the current browsing
  window and F12 bringing up the dev tools for the current browsing window.

- One user uses the default configuration for the function keys. They use the
  keys to change the screen brightness, adjust the volume, etc.

- One user does not use the function keys at all.

### What do you think of the shift, command, and options keys on the right side of your keyboard?

- All users do not use these keys

- One user suggested that they be configured to some other functionality such
  as navigating to the last opened page in the current browsing window tab or
  return to the "New Tab" launch screen instead of having to open a new tab to
  get back to that screen.

- One user suggested that these keys instead be used to start and end different
  "work modes". When you press a key, a set of predefined applications would
  open that correspond to that mode, and all other widows would close.

- One user suggested that these keys be removed to simplify the keyboard.

### Is there a character or a command that you feel like should have its own key?

- One user likes to differentiate between text and code in their notes by
  changing fonts. This user suggested that there be a key that allows for a
  quick change between two fonts when typing.

- One user wished that there was a key, or that they could set an existing key,
  to open a blank note in their favorite note taking app so they spend less time
  opening the application.

- One user wished that there was a key that brought up a list of different
  characters from other alphabets so they could more easily insert these
  characters into their documents.

## Personas

From the user observations, I have devised two personas: Simple Sally and Speed
Demon Dave.

<div class="flex justify-around flex-wrap">
<figure class="max-w-[clamp(450px,_30vw,_650px);]">
<h3 class="text-center">Simple Sally</h3>
<img src="/portfolio/pages/personas_storyboarding/persona_simple_sally.jpg" alt="speed demon dave persona diagram" class="border-4 border-blue"/>
<figcaption>
Figure 1: Simple Sally is a Brown student who feels like computers are too
complicated. She prefers GUIs to keyboard shortcuts to perform certain actions.
<hr />
<span class="not-italic">
Simple Sally does not want to overwhelm herself learning the shortcuts for all
of the applications she uses. In all possible cases, this user performs actions
using GUIs provided by the application.

Sally faces the issues of an overly-complicated keyboard for her purposes. She
finds little use for right-side option, command, shift keys, and function keys.
Consequently, Sally feels that the keyboard would be better off without them.

Sally is based on User 2. Like Sally, User 2 does not use the functions keys or
the right-side command, option, or shift keys. Also like Sally, User 2 felt like
the keyboard layout could be simplified to remove keys that they believe are
rarely used.

<figure class="max-w-[clamp(450px,_30vw,_650px);]">
<h3 class="text-center">Speed Demon Dave</h3>
<img src="/portfolio/pages/personas_storyboarding/persona_speed_demon_dave.jpg" alt="speed demon dave persona diagram" class="border-4 border-blue"/>
<figcaption>
Figure 2: Speed Demon Dave is a Brown student who wants to maximize his
productivity. He tries to learn every shortcut for every application and even
changes his keyboard's default settings to fit his preferences.
<hr />
<span class="not-italic">
Speed Demon Dave does not want to waste time shuffling through GUI menus. He
learns every shortcut and keybinding so he can maximize his output.

Dave is based on User 1 and User 3. Like User 1, Dave uses may keyboard
shortcuts that most users might not even know about. Such as CMD + TAB to change
the active application. Also like how User 1 changed their function keys, Dave
configures the keys on his keyboard to fit his personal workflow.

Like User 3, Dave does not use the track pad, preferring to do as much as
possible on the keyboard. Also like User 3, Dave is fast but not 100% accurate.
He would like there to be a way to bind a key, perhaps one of the right-side
command, option, or shift keys, to some behavior that might increase his
accuracy.

## Storyboard

After creating the personas, I made a storyboard for Simple Sally where she is
having difficulties using a keyboard with a new application she just downloaded.

<ul class="flex flex-wrap gap-[4vw] justify-center list-none p-0">
<li class="w-[275px]">
  <img src="/portfolio/pages/personas_storyboarding/storyboard/frame_1.jpg" alt="frame one" class=" border-4 border-blue w-[275px]"/>
  <p>After 5 years of waiting, Sally has just bought her new MacBook laptop!</p>
</li>
<li class="w-[275px]">
  <img src="/portfolio/pages/personas_storyboarding/storyboard/frame_2.jpg" alt="frame two" class=" border-4 border-blue w-[275px]"/>
  <p>She has heard great things about this new word processor program. Sally downloads the program in hopes to boost her productivity.</p>
</li>
<li class="w-[275px]">
  <img src="/portfolio/pages/personas_storyboarding/storyboard/frame_3.jpg" alt="frame three" class=" border-4 border-blue w-[275px]"/>
  <p>Sally has a hard time understand the word processor. The GUI is more complicated than she expected, and she doesn't know any shortcuts.</p>
</li>
<li class="w-[275px]">
  <img src="/portfolio/pages/personas_storyboarding/storyboard/frame_4.jpg" alt="frame four" class=" border-4 border-blue w-[275px]"/>
  <p>She tries pressing different combinations of keys, hoping to get the behavior she desires. Sally is unsuccessful.</p>
</li>
<li class="w-[275px]">
  <img src="/portfolio/pages/personas_storyboarding/storyboard/frame_5.jpg" alt="frame five" class=" border-4 border-blue w-[275px]"/>
  <p>Sally tries downloading the word processor she used on her old laptop, but that software is too old for her new laptop.</p>
</li>
<li class="w-[275px]">
  <img src="/portfolio/pages/personas_storyboarding/storyboard/frame_6.jpg" alt="frame six" class=" border-4 border-blue w-[275px]"/>
  <p>Sally scours the internet looking for a simpler alternative that she can use to type.</p>
</li>
<li class="w-[275px]">
  <img src="/portfolio/pages/personas_storyboarding/storyboard/frame_7.jpg" alt="frame seven" class=" border-4 border-blue w-[275px]"/>
  <p>Sally finds Google Docs, the perfect solution.</p>
</li>
</ul>
