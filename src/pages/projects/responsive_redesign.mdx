## Overview

The Responsive Redesign project is a class project done for CSCI1300: UI/UX. In
this project, I was tasked with finding a simple website and redesigning the
site to improve responsiveness. You can view the final redesigned site [here](https://naughtynautilus000.github.io/redesigned-site/).

## Goals & Requirements

The Responsive Redesign project has two main goals:

The first goal of the Responsive Redesign project is to identify and redesign a
webpage that has concerns relating to _usability_, _learnability_,
_memorability_, and _accessibility_.

The second goal is to redesign the site first by making prototypes of an
improved design, and then implementing that design using HTML, CSS, and
JavaScript.

The prototyping process consists of the following steps:

1. Creating a Low-fidelity wireframe of a redesigned version of that webpage

2. Creating a visual style guide for the high-fidelity prototype of the
   redesigned webpage.

3. Creating a high-fidelity prototype using the redesigned webpage

The final webpage must be _responsive_ on three different screen sizes: mobile,
tablet, and desktop.

## Selecting a Webpage

The website I chose was the [Antonio's Pizza Online Ordering Page](https://antonios-providence.foodtecsolutions.com/ordering/menu).
I chose this page because I wanted to redesign a website that I have used before
and will probably use again.

Below is an image of the original ordering page. It should be noted that between
the time I redesigned the page and the time of writing this article, Antonio's
Pizza redesigned their page, so the link above will not reflect the image shown
below.

## Problems with the site

The original ordering page has several concerns:

- **_Unclear Hierarchy:_** When looking at all of the menu items, there are
  headings that separate the catagories of menu items, and then the actual menu
  items themselves. The font for the categories is different than the menu items
  but the font for the menu items is bolded and larger than the font for the
  headings.

- **_Unclear Grouping of Menu Contents:_** The name of each menu item has a grey
  background. The corresponding description of the name is on a white
  background. This creates a separation between the names and descriptions of
  menu items which makes the menu harder to read.

- **_Lack of Semantic HTML:_** Most of the markup for this page consists of
  nested `<div>` tags used for styling purposes. The actual text is contained in
  heading tags in a proper hierarchical structure, but theses heading tags are
  separated between multiple levels of nested `<div>` tags which can still make
  parsing difficult.

- **_Poor Greyscale Contrast:_** When looking at the page in greyscale. Selected
  menu items appear very similar unselected items. For certain kinds of
  colorblindness, this lack of contrast could make the page difficult to read.

### WebAIM Wave Analysis

WebAIM Wave actually gives this site a good rating. The only areas of concern
were the use of device-dependent event handlers, redundant alternate text, and
low contrast errors.

The low contrast errors were surprising to me, as I feel that the site has very
good contrast outside of the greyscale point mentioned above. When looking at
the site in full color, everything on the page is easy to read.

## Low-Fidelity Prototypes

To create my low-fidelity prototypes of my redesigned page, I used
[Balsamiq Wireframes](https://balsamiq.com/). I made one prototype for each of
the three screen sizes with images shown below:

<div class="flex flex-row flex-wrap gap-8 justify-center">
<img src="/pages/responsive_redesign/wireframes/desktop.png" alt="desktop wireframe" class="w-[600px] border-2 border-blue" />
<img src="/pages/responsive_redesign/wireframes/tablet.png" alt="tablet wireframe" class="w-[300px] border-2 border-blue" />
<img src="/pages/responsive_redesign/wireframes/mobile.png" alt="mobile wireframe" class="w-[200px] border-2 border-blue" />
</div>

## High-Fidelity Style Guide

In preparation for the high fidelity prototypes, I created a style guide, which
is a collection of UI elements and their different states that all work together
under one theme. The elements in the style guide are effectively the building
blocks for a complete UI. I constructed the style guide in [Figma](https://www.figma.com/about/),
and the style guide is imaged below:

<img src="/pages/responsive_redesign/style_guide.png" alt="style guide" class="w-3/4 mx-auto border-2 border-blue"/>

## High-Fidelity Prototypes

Also in Figma, I created a high-fidelity prototype of each of the three screen
sizes. It should be noted that for the tablet and mobile views, the cart is
hidden by default. To see the cart, click on the cart icon on the top left
corner of the page. To hide the cart again, click somewhere else besides the
cart icon or the cart itself.

<div class="flex flex-col items-center gap-5">
<img src="/pages/responsive_redesign/prototypes/desktop_annotated.png" alt="desktop high-fidelity prototype" class="border-2 border-blue" />
<img src="/pages/responsive_redesign/prototypes/tablet_annotated.png" alt="tablet high-fidelity prototype" class="border-2 border-blue" />
<img src="/pages/responsive_redesign/prototypes/mobile_annotated.png" alt="mobile high-fidelity prototype" class="border-2 border-blue" />
</div>
