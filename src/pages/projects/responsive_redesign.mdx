## Overview

The Responsive Redesign project is a class project done for CSCI1300: UI/UX. In
this project, I was tasked with finding a simple website and redesigning the
site to improve responsiveness.

## Goals & Requirements

The Responsive Redesign project has two main goals:

The first goal of the Responsive Redesign project is to identify and redesign a
webpage that has concerns relating to _usability_, _learnability_,
_memorability_, and _accessibility_.

The second goal is to redesign the site first by making prototypes of an
improved design, and then implementing that design using HTML, CSS, and
JavaScript.

The prototyping process consists of the following steps:

1. Creating a Low-fidelity wireframe of a redesigned version of that webpage

2. Creating a visual style guide for the high-fidelity prototype of the

3. Creating a high-fidelity prototype using the redesigned webpage

The final webpage must be _responsive_ on three different screen sizes: mobile,
tablet, and desktop.
